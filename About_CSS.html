<em><h1>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets</h1></em>
    <p>
        <em><strong>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</strong></em> It describes how Html elements should be displayed on screen. It is a powerful tool 
        for web designers to change the design and control over web pages that how it should be displayed. It is supported by all 
        browsers and is designed primarily to separate the document content from document presentation.
        It was developed by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 1996. 
        Term cascading in CSS implies the fact that you can apply multiple style sheets to a single web page. Extension used to save 
        CSS files is ".css".

    If you want to undestand the basics of CSS of course you can got to special website.
    I would prefer the w3schools website. There are a lot of lessons and code explanations 
    to undestand how CSS works.
    To go to w3schools, click on that <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_examples.asp">link</a>.
