    <em><h1>The meaning of HTML</h1></em>   
    <p> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
        HTML describes the structure of a Web page
        HTML consists of a series of elements
        HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
        HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</p>
    <em><h2>Example of code in HTML</h2></em>
    <p>
        A lot of website use an HTML language to manage text. And a lot of people doesn't 
        undestand that HTML is basics of website. And to show how does it look to code in HTML,
        I gived a little example, which is refering to another website. The
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">Example</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        But if you have no time to check another website, I put for you a little screenshot,
        which can help you to see a small part of code in HTML.

    <p>
        But of course the HTML language can't be used to create the newest websites.
        And the second language that is used in pair with HTML is CSS.

    <em><h1>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets</h1></em>
    <p>
        <em><strong>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</strong></em> It describes how Html elements should be displayed on screen. It is a powerful tool 
        for web designers to change the design and control over web pages that how it should be displayed. It is supported by all 
        browsers and is designed primarily to separate the document content from document presentation.
        It was developed by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 1996. 
        Term cascading in CSS implies the fact that you can apply multiple style sheets to a single web page. Extension used to save 
        CSS files is ".css".
