    <em><h1>The meaning of HTML</h1></em>   
    <p> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
        HTML describes the structure of a Web page
        HTML consists of a series of elements
        HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
        HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</p>
    <em><h2>Example of code in HTML</h2></em>
    <p>
        A lot of website use an HTML language to manage text. And a lot of people doesn't 
        undestand that HTML is basics of website. And to show how does it look to code in HTML,
        I gived a little example, which is refering to another website. The
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">Example</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        But if you have no time to check another website, I put for you a little screenshot,
        which can help you to see a small part of code in HTML.

        But of course the HTML language can't be used to create the newest websites.
        And the second language that is used in pair with HTML is CSS.
